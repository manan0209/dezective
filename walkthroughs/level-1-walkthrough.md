## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Investigation**

### **Phase 1: Getting Your Bearings** ‚≠ê

When you start the level, you'll be in your detective workspace. Let's understand what tools you have available.

**Step 1.1: Check where you are**
```bash
pwd
```
**Expected Output**: `/home/detective`

**Step 1.2: See what's available in your workspace**
```bash
ls
```
**Expected Output**: `mission_brief.txt`

**Step 1.3: Read your mission briefing**
```bash
cat mission_brief.txt
```

**What You'll Learn**: This shows you the available commands and gives you the investigation roadmap. Notice it mentions checking the `/evidence/` folder first.

### **Phase 2: Understanding the Incident** üîç

Now let's investigate what actually happened with the GTA VI leak.

**Step 2.1: Navigate to the evidence folder**
```bash
cd /evidence
```

**Step 2.2: See what evidence is available**
```bash
ls
```
**Expected Output**: `incident_report.txt`

**Step 2.3: Read the incident report**
```bash
cat incident_report.txt
```

**üß† What This Teaches You**: 
- **Timeline analysis** - Understanding when events occurred
- **Attack vectors** - How hackers gain access (through open ports)
- **Impact assessment** - The damage caused by security breaches
- **Investigation methodology** - Following the digital breadcrumbs

**Key Findings**:
- The leak happened through game testing infrastructure
- A network port was left open without firewall protection
- The hacker used automated tools to find the vulnerability
- Next step: Check the `/network/` folder for detailed logs

---

### **Phase 3: Network Forensics** üåê

This is where you learn how hackers actually find vulnerabilities!

**Step 3.1: Navigate to the network logs**
```bash
cd /network
```

**Step 3.2: See what network data is available**
```bash
ls
```
**Expected Output**: `connection_log.txt  port_scan.txt`

**Step 3.3: Check the port scan results** (This is the smoking gun!)
```bash
cat port_scan.txt
```

**üß† What This Teaches You**:
- **Port scanning basics** - How attackers discover open services
- **Common network ports** and their purposes:
  - Port 22: SSH (secure remote access)
  - Port 80: HTTP (web traffic)
  - Port 443: HTTPS (secure web traffic)
  - Port 6789: **THE VULNERABLE PORT!**
- **Firewall importance** - Why ports need protection
- **Risk assessment** - Understanding "CRITICAL" vs "SECURE" findings

**Key Discovery**: Port 6789 is **OPEN TO INTERNET** with **FIREWALL DISABLED** - this is how the hacker got in!

**Step 3.4: Confirm the attack with connection logs**
```bash
cat connection_log.txt
```

**üß† What This Teaches You**:
- **Log analysis skills** - Reading network connection records
- **Suspicious activity identification** - External IP connecting to internal systems
- **Data exfiltration detection** - Large file downloads (156.2MB = GTA VI files!)
- **Timeline correlation** - Matching suspicious connections to leak timing

**Key Evidence**: 
- External IP `203.0.113.25` connected to vulnerable port 6789
- Hacker downloaded exactly the files that got leaked
- Attack happened right before the social media posts appeared

### **Phase 4: Interactive Security Response** üõ°Ô∏è

Now comes the exciting part - you don't just read about the solution, you actually implement it yourself!

**Step 4.1: Navigate to security solutions**
```bash
cd /security
```

**Step 4.2: See what security information is available**
```bash
ls
```
**Expected Output**: `firewall_instructions.txt  lesson_learned.txt  port_status.txt`

**Step 4.3: Read the security instructions**
```bash
cat firewall_instructions.txt
```

**üß† What This Teaches You**:
- **Active remediation** - You'll run the actual security commands
- **Network diagnostics** - Using `netstat` to see open ports
- **Firewall configuration** - Using `iptables` to block threats
- **Real-world skills** - Commands used by actual security teams

**Step 4.4: Check what ports are currently open** ‚ö†Ô∏è **INTERACTIVE STEP**
```bash
netstat -tuln
```

**üß† What This Shows You**:
- Live view of all active network ports
- Port 6789 is highlighted as **VULNERABLE**
- Exactly what hackers see when scanning systems
- How to identify security risks in real-time

**Key Finding**: You'll see port 6789 is **LISTENING** and marked as the vulnerability!

**Step 4.5: Close the vulnerable port** üö® **MISSION-CRITICAL STEP**
```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6789 -j DROP
```

**üß† What This Command Does**:
- `iptables`: Linux firewall configuration tool (industry standard)
- `-A INPUT`: Add rule to incoming traffic
- `-p tcp`: Apply to TCP protocol
- `--dport 6789`: Target port 6789 specifically  
- `-j DROP`: Drop (block) all connections to this port

**üéâ SUCCESS!** After running this command, you'll see:
- Confirmation that the firewall rule was added
- Port 6789 is now **BLOCKED** from external access
- **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED** message
- The GTA VI vulnerability is **PATCHED**!

**Step 4.6: Claim your achievement!** üèÜ
```bash
cat /security/mission_complete.txt
```

This file only appears **after** you've successfully run both security commands, proving you actually fixed the vulnerability!

**Step 4.7: Learn the cybersecurity concepts** (Highly recommended!)
```bash
cat lesson_learned.txt
```

**üß† What This Teaches You**:
- **Network security fundamentals** explained simply

cd /evidence                                        # Go to evidence
cat incident_report.txt                             # Understand what happened
cd /network                                         # Check network data
cat port_scan.txt                                  # Find the vulnerable port (6789!)
cat connection_log.txt                              # Confirm the attack
cd /security                                        # Check solutions
cat firewall_instructions.txt                       # Read the instructions
netstat -tuln                                      # ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED: Check open ports
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6789 -j DROP      # üö® REQUIRED: Close port 6789
